### Limitations
Modern web browsers do not let websites play sound without user interaction or
display bunch of popup dialogs, **so you need to interact
with the website (click around, allow popups etc.) in 
order to get the "full experience".**

And also you may want to turn down the volume!

When you are ready, [click here](http://145.89.192.191/Do-not-click-this/) to visit
the website

### Where can I learn more about this wonderful website?
[The Legend of YouAreAnIdiot.org](https://youtu.be/kgs2WTlkp5g) is very informing.

<br>

### How do I stop it???
Use `killall` command to kill your browser:
```bash
killall -9 firefox
```
Or use the task manager if you are on windows.
Another option is just to wait untill your browser or your computer crashes.
